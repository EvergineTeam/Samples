# Evergine Samples

This repository contains all the samples code that are part of any topic under the last Evergine stable version based on .NET 6.

We are using different Github repositories to make it easy to download each of them individually. The complete list of samples is using Evergine 2023.9.28 and to build these you only need to restore the Nuget dependencies and build the project respectively.

# Samples list.

## MAUI showcase
This showcase demonstrates the seamless integration of __MAUI__ and __Evergine__. Leveraging the latest Evergine release, you can access a new MAUI project template, enabling the creation of exceptional mobile applications for both Android and iOS. This template facilitates the development of captivating UIs with MAUI, allowing for the inclusion of a 3D canvas in your views to render engaging 3D content.
