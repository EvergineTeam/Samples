# WaveEngine 3.1 Samples

This repository contains all the samples code that are part of any topic under the new WaveEngine 3.1 version based on .NET 5.

We are using different Github repositories to make it easy to download each of them individually. The complete list of samples is using WaveEngine 3.1 and to build these you only need to restore the Nuget dependencies and build the project respectively.

# Samples list.

## The standard post-processing graph
This demo scene uses WaveEngine 3.1 with .NET 5 support. The new Post-processing graph is used with several effects such as Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO), Screen Space Reflection (SSR), Temporal Antialiasing (TAA), Depth of Field (DoF), Bloom, and Tonemapping and you can check it on DirectX11, DirectX12 and Vulkan.
