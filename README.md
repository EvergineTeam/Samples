# WaveEngine 3.1 Samples

This repository contains all the samples code that are part of any topic under the new WaveEngine 3.1 version based on .NET 5.

We are using different Github repositories to make it easy to download each of them individually. The complete list of samples is using WaveEngine 3.1 and to build these you only need to restore the Nuget dependencies and build the project respectively.

# Samples list.

## Mixed Reality Demo
WaveEngine.MRTK is a project that provides a set of components and features used to accelerate cross-platform XR application development in Wave Engine.

## UI API integrations
This demo shows how you can integrate WaveEngine in an application using the WindowSystem. The Windows Forms and SDL uses the full window to render the application and the WPF sample demonstrates a way to include a WaveEngine renderer and how it can interact with WPF controls.
